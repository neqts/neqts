Hello there 👋
My name is Radek and I am Junior Web Developer from Poland. I work as a Junior Salesforce Developer by day. My passion for programming started when I was in high school and it continues until now. Both in college and privately, I spend most of my time learning web development. Currently I'm focusing on Salesforce and Gatsby.js. I invite you to check out my projects here.
